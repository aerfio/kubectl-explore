# kubectl-explore

This command is a better `kubectl explain` with the fuzzy-finder.

## What

`kubectl-explore` finds fields associated with each supported API resource to explain.

## Motivation

`kubectl explain` is already helpful, but typing the accurate path to the filed to explain is a tedious and typo-prone.
